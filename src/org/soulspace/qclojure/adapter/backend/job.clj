  "Functions for managing quantum jobs on AWS Braket and other backends.
   
   This namespace provides functions to submit quantum circuits as jobs, monitor their status, retrieve results, and handle job lifecycle events. It abstracts away the specifics of the underlying quantum hardware or simulator, allowing users to interact with a consistent API regardless of the execution environment."
