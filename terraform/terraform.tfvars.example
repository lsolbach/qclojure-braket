# Example Terraform Variables Configuration
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize for your environment

# Basic Configuration
bucket_name = "amazon-braket-results-bucket"  # Must be globally unique
environment = "dev"                       # dev, staging, or prod
aws_region  = "us-east-1"                # Most Braket devices are in us-east-1

# Resource Naming
name_prefix = "qclojure-braket"          # Prefix for IAM resources

# Security Settings
enable_encryption = true                  # Enable S3 encryption (recommended)
enable_versioning = true                  # Enable S3 versioning (recommended)

# Cost Management
lifecycle_expiration_days = 90           # Auto-delete results after 90 days

# CloudWatch Configuration
enable_cloudwatch         = false        # Disable for cost savings in experiments
cloudwatch_retention_days  = 30          # Log retention (if CloudWatch enabled)

# Additional Tags (optional)
tags = {
  Project     = "QClojure Quantum Computing"
  Owner       = "your-email@example.com"
  Environment = "development"
  CostCenter  = "research"
}

# Example configurations for different environments:

# Development Environment (minimal costs)
# bucket_name               = "dev-braket-results-yourname"
# environment              = "dev"
# lifecycle_expiration_days = 30
# enable_versioning        = false
# enable_cloudwatch        = false

# Production Environment (full monitoring)
# bucket_name               = "prod-braket-results-company"
# environment              = "prod"
# lifecycle_expiration_days = 365
# enable_versioning        = true
# enable_cloudwatch        = true
# cloudwatch_retention_days = 90
